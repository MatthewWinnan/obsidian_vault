# Introduction
The following serves as a simple introduction to my new found hobby
of playing, collecting and modding boardgames. Everything will be based in
South-Africa (RSA).

One might wonder how I have time and money for everything ....

The main contents will be:
- Wish list, organizing games by owned, wanting to buy and next planned purchase.
- Sleeving list, organizing games by sleeved and planning to.
- Insert list, organizing games by ones I have made inserts for (includes links to inserts), planning on making inserts for
and ones that I think the base does a good job. I will also be including what each insert supports, expansion wise.
- Lists of stores that I get said games from
