Just a note to help track some links to 3D printable keyboard designs, I essentially want to make a macropad.

- [6x4 Macropad](https://www.printables.com/model/600265-wireless-6x4-macropad-zmk/files), basic macropad design to maybe build off of.
- [Keybow Macropad](https://www.printables.com/model/228327-keybow2040-macropad-with-display-and-encoder/comments), I like this one since it gives an idea for OLED and encoder.
- [Ultipad MK2](https://www.printables.com/model/299781-theultipad-mk2-now-with-oled-display-and-rgb-under), very good looking 23 key pad. Gives idea for OLED and encoder.
- [DIY Mechanical Macro Keypad â€• Ocreeb](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5535019/files), watched this one (V2) and very good video. He did PCB print it but I can check how to make it pop in.
-  [Hot Swap Bit](https://www.printables.com/model/158559-handwire-hot-swap-socket-for-mechanical-keyboards/comments), I can use this to make the switch hot-swapable. This will just go under the standard pop in idea and be soldered together instead of the wiring idea in the main guide. The [Guide ](https://github.com/stingray127/handwirehotswap)
- [Mechanical Gamepad/Macro Pad for Cherry MX or Gateron Switches](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2593692/remixes), nice slanted design can add some things?
- [Popped Out Knob](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5201035/files), I like the idea of this one with the external knob.
- [68-Keys](https://www.printables.com/model/73567-3d-printed-mechanical-keyboard-68-keys), initial one that got me into this and gave me the idea.
