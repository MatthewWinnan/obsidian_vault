This is my digital garden for all things home lab, coding, engineering and paleoanthropology related.

The basic structure of the vault is rather simple. You have global topics which are used as the entry points to sub-topics. Each sub-topic is a directory with their own notes.

Currently the topics include #HomeLabSetup and #PCBuild. The latter focuses on research for my upcoming PC build.

## General Navigation
