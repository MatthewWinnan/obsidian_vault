Same good template repositories that I have found:
- [XNM1](https://github.com/XNM1/linux-nixos-hyprland-config-dotfiles)
	- 
- [Sukhmancs](https://github.com/sukhmancs/nixos-configs)
	- Used the rofi-wayland config with my own stylix colors/overrides.
	- Used his disko config, specifically [luks-btrfs](https://github.com/sukhmancs/nixos-configs/tree/f7df37cd6f994be5e5cfbaa1bc9029b8a2399813/disko/luks-btrfs-subvolumes)
	- Taking insperation for the nixvim config
- [Misterio77](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-config/tree/5735a6e72064c57f6cb5370d99dae72098646671)
	- Took inspiration from his boiler plate nix-config.
	- My monitor definition comes directly from him.
- [Vimjoyer](https://github.com/vimjoyer)
	- His youtube videos are very good. 
	- Used his LF setup video for mine ([Repo](https://github.com/vimjoyer/lf-nix-video), [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8y_qRUYEWU)). 
	- A good video is his one on [Stylix](https://github.com/danth/stylix), I will be using this in conjunction with colors listed later on ([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljHkWgBaQWU)).
	- Yet another nix helper is also quite great, however I have moved my home manager as a Nix module ([NH](https://github.com/viperML/nh), [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnA4xNTrrqY&t=298s)).
- [Ampersand](https://www.youtube.com/@Ampersand-xc9jp)
	- Makes some good Nix content too.
	- His intro [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLwbNhSxLd4&t=832s) helped a ton.
	- His [repo](https://github.com/Andrey0189/nixos-config) took most of my nixvim setup from here and used this as my main overall starting point.
- [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/nix)
	- Currently using their Macchiato color pallet with Stylix.
	- Based my hyprlock off of their example and using logo images.
	- Based my wlogout from their examples, took the same logos (might pass it through a color transformer for theming???)
	- Bssed my waybar off of it might change back to something else.
