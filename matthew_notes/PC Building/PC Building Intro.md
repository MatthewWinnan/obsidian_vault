The following note will serve as an entry point for the research I am doing in order to plan out my future PC build. 

The main idea for the build would be a machine that can do 4k gaming ideally, AI workloads since I want to start looking into that and playing around with different frameworks. Further it should also be capable of multiprocessing and to be used as a workstation. By multiprocessing I mean run multiple concurrent applications. This spec sheet already puts us at the high-end of PC components (for the average consumer).

Below is the summarised list of my ideal components. If accompanying research was needed to get to the conclusion then that is also further included.
