The following note details my research into what CPU I would ideally be going for. 

First of we will not go into the nuance of [x86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86), [ARM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family) and [RISCV](https://riscv.org/). 

The recent [[ARM Improvements]] as of writing this report is quite impressive. There is definitely a shift in the adoption of ARM for desktop computers. Especially since the introduction of the [Windows for ARM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/arm/overview). However this is still early and the shift from gaming, which the PC's purpose will also be, is not there yet. And will probably not be there for a while. 

While I love using ARM for many of my planned #HomeLabSetup devices the better software support for the x86 can not be overlooked and will still remain a viable candidate for a long time.

I am very excited about the [[RiscV Improvements]] too however this is out of the scope of general user requirements. For large data centres and specialised hardware solutions this remains very nice and in my own work we are using it for our smart NIC's. 

Out of x86 AMD and Intel are the only real choice. The recent commotion with 13 and 14 gen Intel chips failing [(1)](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/alderon-games-claims-that-substantial-numbers-of-intel-13th-gen-and-14th-gen-chips-are-defective.324402/) has made me weary and at the very least reluctant to buy into Intel. Further I have a soft spot for AMD after working with them in data centres. There is much much more to say.... however I will just point to a performance data sheet I grabbed somewhere...
